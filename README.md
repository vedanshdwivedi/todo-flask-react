TODO APP 

This basic app has been coded to understand how the following things are working

- Flask Backend
- React Frontend
- Communicating and passing data between frontend and backend

To see this project in action follow the steps:

Step 1: Clone this repository locally and open a terminal with project folder path as the target location
Step 2: Run command "bash setup-env.sh" (without quotes) to setup a virtual environment and install required packages

Step 3: Run command "bash launch_backend.sh" (without quotes) to start backend locally on port 5000
Step 4: Open a new terminal in the the same directory and run command "bash launch_frontend.sh" (without quotes) to start frontend on port 3000

Step 5: Open a browser and head to http://localhost:3000 to see the system in action.


Contributions and suggestions are most welcome.
